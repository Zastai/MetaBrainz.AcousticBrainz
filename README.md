# MetaBrainz.AcousticBrainz [![Build Status][CI-S]][CI-L] [![NuGet Package Version][NuGet-S]][NuGet-L]

_The AcousticBrainz project was halted in 2022; this repository will be
archived until such time as that changes._

This is a library providing access to the
[AcousticBrainz API v1][api-reference].

The [AcousticBrainz][home] project aims to crowd source acoustic
information for all music in the world and to make it available to the
public. This acoustic information describes the acoustic characteristics
of music and includes low-level spectral information and information for
genres, moods, keys, scales and much more.
